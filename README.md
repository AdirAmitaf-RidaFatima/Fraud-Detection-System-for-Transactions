# üõ°Ô∏è Fraud Detection System for Transactions (Python Project)

##  Project Overview

This project is a **rule-based financial fraud detection system** implemented in Python. It is designed to process **single or multiple financial transactions** and identify suspicious activity using real-world logic and best practices from fintech, banking, and fraud analytics.

We build the system in **steps**:

1. First, we test the detection logic on **one transaction**.
2. Then we scale to **multiple transactions**.
3. Finally, we import transaction data from a **CSV file**, simulating how it's used in real systems.

All code is written with **self-explanatory comments** so that anyone‚Äîbeginner or advanced‚Äîcan understand it easily.

## Key Concepts Covered

- Threshold-based anomaly detection
- Location-based fraud heuristics
- Time-based rule flags (e.g., odd-hour withdrawals)
- Duplicate or rapid successive transactions
- Transaction type logic (e.g., suspicious transfers)
- Looping and validation of multiple transactions
- Using pandas to read and process `.csv` data
- Modular, reusable rule-based architecture
- Industry-inspired examples and real-case logic

## How the Logic Works (Step-by-Step)

### Step 1: Detecting Fraud in a Single Transaction
We first create small functions (rules) that check whether **one transaction** looks suspicious.

Example rule functions:
- `is_large_transaction(txn)`
- `is_night_time_transaction(txn)`
- `is_suspicious_location(txn)`
- etc.

We then call a `check_transaction_for_fraud(txn)` that runs all rule functions and returns any flags.

### Step 2: Scaling to Multiple Transactions
We build a loop to go through a **list or table of transactions**, checking each one individually using our fraud rules.

Each transaction gets:
- Its own set of fraud flags
- A result whether it's suspicious or not

### Step 3: Working with CSV File (Real Dataset Simulation)
We create or upload a `.csv` file with sample data using columns like:

csv
transaction_id,account_id,amount,location,transaction_type,time

We then use pandas to load and analyze each row as a transaction:

python
Copy
Edit
import pandas as pd
df = pd.read_csv("sample_transactions.csv")
We loop through the DataFrame rows and run our fraud checks for each row.

Sample CSV File Structure
transaction_id	account_id	amount	location	transaction_type	time
TXN1001	ACC2001	9500	New York	transfer	2024-06-01 14:30:00
TXN1002	ACC2002	15000	Karachi	withdrawal	2024-06-01 02:15:00
TXN1003	ACC2001	9700	New York	transfer	2024-06-01 14:45:00

... and so on.

We provide 100 sample transactions, including 5 that are purposefully suspicious for demo/testing.

# How to Run the Project
## Option 1: Google Colab
Open Google Colab

Click "Upload Notebook" or create a new one.
Upload your .csv file:
Use the upload feature in Colab sidebar
Or use files.upload() in code
Paste or run the full fraud detection notebook code
Results are printed inline

## Option 2: GitHub Codespaces (or Locally with VSCode)
Clone the repo:
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/fraud-detection-python.git
cd fraud-detection-python
Install Requirements (if needed)
pip install pandas
Run the main script or Jupyter Notebook:
jupyter notebook
OR
python fraud_detection.py

## Future Enhancements
Machine Learning-based detection (e.g., Isolation Forest, Logistic Regression)
Risk scoring system instead of binary flags
Real-time transaction API support
Streamlit Dashboard for visualization
